## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository

This repository contains **all my code, exercises, and projects** from the C++ for Robotics course.  

I took this course to **master C++ programming** and learn how to apply it to **robotics control, simulations, and embedded systems**.  
It covers everything from **C++ basics** to **advanced programming techniques** used in robotics.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ C++ Fundamentals
- Setting up a C++ development environment
- Variables, data types, operators
- Control flow: if/else, loops, switch statements
- Functions and parameter passing
- Input/output with `cin` / `cout`

### ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Operator overloading

### ðŸ”¹ Memory Management
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new` / `delete`)
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
- Understanding stack vs heap

### ðŸ”¹ Data Structures & Algorithms
- Arrays, vectors, lists, stacks, queues
- Maps, sets, and iterators
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Time and space complexity basics

### ðŸ”¹ Robotics Applications
- Using C++ for control systems
- Implementing PID controllers
- Sensor data handling
- Path planning basics
- Simulation with robotics frameworks

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced C++ Concepts
- Templates and generic programming
- Namespaces and modular programming
- Exception handling
- File handling (read/write)
- Multi-threading and concurrency basics
